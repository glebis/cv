## TODO

[] Logos, illustrations
[] Decide whether to have a section on earlier experience (which goes back to 2001)
[] Decide if I want to drop certain positions altogether (move FoggyLab experience into Raum7 block?)
[] Link to the projects where possible
[] Decide if I need publications at all, find all relevant content I can and link to it (Afisha, Hopes&Fears, Lookatme, Lifehacker)
[] Decide if I need to copy testimonials from LI
[] Decide if I want to have something outstanding: experience matrix, timeline? HR people don't like this kind of stuff
