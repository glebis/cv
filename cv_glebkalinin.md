# Gleb Kalinin

I have 12+ years of experience in web design, UX and product development, both online and offline. I launched several projects of my own, managed my own consulting company, worked as a product manager, UX designer and project manager.

I worked for large brands, startups of different scale and I know what startups are about. All of the startups failed. I've learned to focus on the main stuff first: value creation, marketing and value distribution, cashflow. I learned to spot nonsense and cut the crap right away. I learnt to care about the business in its entirety. 

I always try to deliver as much value as possible. I care about end-product and the value people get from it.
